Navigating insurance options in the U.S. can be a complex task, often requiring customers to browse multiple websites to find a plan that meets their budget and coverage needs. This can be time-consuming and may lead customers to settle for expensive plans. WeCare addresses this by offering a unified platform where customers can quickly compare premiums from four well-established insurers: Geico, AllState, State Farm, and Progressive. With a built-in broker feature, WeCare assists users unfamiliar with the insurance landscape, guiding them to the most cost-effective plans. An analytics dashboard provides insights into popular policies and highlights top-earning sales agents, while real-time notifications keep customers informed at every step of the process.

WeCare supports a complete insurance journey, from policy selection to claim settlement. Customers can self-navigate or request help from sales agents, who earn commissions for successful policy facilitation. Dynamic premium cost calculations enable users to see real-time pricing adjustments. Developed with Java, Java Swing for a user-friendly interface, MySQL for data management, and JDBC for seamless connectivity, WeCare delivers an efficient, user-centered solution for buying and managing insurance plans.
